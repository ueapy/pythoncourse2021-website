# Installation instructions

For this workshop you need to install Python on your laptop!

Follow the instructions below to set up your Python environment. The only requirement is that you have to do this **before** the course! Feel free to contact [Tiago](mailto:tiago.silva@cefas.co.uk) if you have any problems with the installation (but better google them first!)

Note: **the course is designed in Python 3.8**. Even if you have a different version installed, 3.8 will be installed when creating a conda environment in step 3 below.

## 1. Install Python distribution using Anaconda
1.1. [Download Anaconda with Python 3 for your OS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). If you have a Cefas laptop, **do not** install Python from the Cefas Software Centre.

1.2. Install it following [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Be sure to select install "just me" when prompted.

## 2. Download course materials
The material for the workshop can be directly downloaded as a [zip file](https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2021-materials/archive/master.zip) or can be cloned from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2021-materials).


### Option 1: Download ZIP file
Download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2021-materials/archive/master.zip) and unpack it in a suitable directory, for example, in `Downloads` folder.

### Option 2: Using Git
#### 2.1. Install Git
If you don't have git version control system installed, you can install it following these instructions:
##### Linux
Use your package manager. For example, using aptitude you would run the following terminal command: `sudo apt-get install git`
##### Mac
* The XCode command line tools need to be installed.
* Install XCode if it isnâ€™t already. XCode is available in the Mac App Store for free.
* Launch XCode and accept the license agreement.
* Quit XCode.
* Open a new terminal and run the command xcode-select --install
* Select install on the pop-up menu.
##### Windows
Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### 2.2. Clone the repository
2.2.1. Open the command line (Git bash, terminal or cmd.exe)

2.2.2. (Linux or Mac, optional) Change to a suitable directory (e.g. `cd /home/yourname/Documents`)

2.2.3. Clone the repo by typing

```
git clone https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2021-materials.git
```
This should create a local copy of the course materials in the current directory.

Windows-users, double check that it has been cloned in the directory you wanted.


## 3. Create the environment
3.1. Make sure Anaconda is installed and the course materials are downloaded

3.2. Open the command line (e.g., OS X terminal on Mac; **Anaconda prompt** on Windows)

3.3. Navigate to the cloned / downloaded folder (using `cd` command), for example:

```
cd C:\Users\myname\Downloads\pythoncourse2021-materials\
```

3.4. Create the environment using `conda` package manager:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will take some time depending on your Internet speed (<15 minutes).
If you get stuck try typying return or creating the environment again.

## 4. Activate the environment
### Linux / Mac
If your default shell is NOT bash, first type `bash`. Activate the relevant environment by typing:
```bash
source activate course2021
```
### Windows
Still in the command line (Anaconda prompt), type:
```
activate course2021
```

## 5. Test the installation (essential!)
From the terminal type:
```
python -c "import seaborn"
```
If you don't get any errors then your installation was sucessful.

## 6. Launch Jupyter
Once the environment is activated, type 
```
jupyter notebook
```
in the command line. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your browser. 

## Still having trouble?
If you are unable to install Anaconda Python on your PC, contact the [course organisers](index.md#registration-and-enquiries).
Another option: launch the course in the cloud! [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/ueapy/pythoncourse2021-materials). This requires no installation but progress and modifications won't be saved.
